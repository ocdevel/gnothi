The current task is that in Sharing.tsx, you can see the line `// FIXME this is a bug, share.user.id should always be present`. When the user first logs in, everything is fine - they see the UserSwitcher with the correct email addresses (the first one being the logged in UserB, the second one being UserA who has shared with UserB). But when UserB clicks on UserA's email address, the UserSwitchers becomes broken; it shows 1 user with "unknown user", and the the fixme line becomes a problem. You'll need to see how the `uid` and `vid` system is working on the backend, after a user activates teh Zustand `store.user.as` system, in addition to seeing what's going wrong on the frontend
